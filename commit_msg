Fix: Refactor order endpoints to return dicts and prevent JSON serialization errors

- Converted all SQLite row results to Python dictionaries in order-related methods.
- Fixed get_order_by_id, get_orders_by_user, and get_orders to support JSON responses correctly.
- Improved logging for better debugging of API calls.
- Ensured pagination works properly in admin order listing.
- Enabled foreign key constraints and consistent row_factory usage in database connection.
